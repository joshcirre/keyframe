## Description (4000 characters max)

Keyframe is a professional music performance app for live musicians. Whether you're on stage or in the studio, Keyframe gives you everything you need: a powerful synth host, intelligent MIDI processing, and seamless control of your Mac setup.

**TWO POWERFUL MODES**

• Local Mode: A complete standalone performance engine
• Remote Mode: Control your Mac Keyframe session wirelessly

**LOCAL MODE - YOUR PORTABLE STUDIO**

Transform your iPhone or iPad into a professional performance instrument:

• 4-Channel Mixer with volume, pan, and mute
• Host any AUv3 instrument or effect
• Built-in scale filtering with 13 scale types
• Diatonic chord engine for one-finger chords
• MIDI Freeze/Hold to sustain notes indefinitely
• Simple looper for recording and layering
• Full session save and restore
• Background audio for uninterrupted performance

**REMOTE MODE - CONTROL YOUR MAC**

Connect to Keyframe Mac over your local network:

• Automatic discovery via Bonjour
• One-tap preset and section selection
• Real-time sync of active section
• Bi-directional master volume control
• Auto-reconnect on network changes

**INTELLIGENT MIDI PROCESSING**

Keyframe's built-in MIDI engine handles the hard work:

• Scale Filtering: Snap or block out-of-scale notes
• 13 Scales: Major, Minor, Dorian, Pentatonic, Blues, and more
• Chord Generation: Turn single notes into full chords
• MIDI Learn: Map any controller in seconds
• Song Triggers: Switch presets via MIDI

**DESIGNED FOR THE STAGE**

Inspired by Teenage Engineering's aesthetic:

• High-contrast interface visible under stage lights
• Large touch targets for confident control
• Minimal UI that stays out of your way
• Dark and light modes

**LOOPER & FREEZE**

New performance tools for creative expression:

• MIDI Freeze: Hold notes with your sustain pedal (sustain or toggle mode)
• Simple Looper: Record from master output, plays back even when you change presets
• Bar-based recording: Auto-stop at 4, 8, or 16 bars

**CONNECT EVERYTHING**

• Hardware MIDI controllers
• Network MIDI sessions
• Bluetooth MIDI (WIDI, etc.)
• External gear via MIDI output

Perfect for keyboardists, producers, and performers who want professional tools without the complexity.
